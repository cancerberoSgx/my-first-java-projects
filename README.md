Sebastian Gurin Old Java Projects

I revived this old java projects of mine, which I build when I was young mostly to learn Java Programming language. 

My motivation, besides not losing this code, is now to learn the gradle build tool, and in this case I package these inter-dependent projects in a gradle multi project. 

# Build and RUN

```sh

gradle build
java -jar picture-makeup/build/libs/PictureMakeup-0.0.2.jar
java -jar desktop-media-tools/build/libs/desktop-media-tools-0.0.2.jar

```
