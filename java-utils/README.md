cancerberosgx java-* projects are some java work from when we was a child and was learning - now I want to revive them, put them in github, add support for better build systems, CI and distribution just for fun

# java-util

core utilities for cancerberosgx java-* projects

# build

```sh
gradle
``` 

and jars should be in `build/libs/java-utils-0.0.1.jar`
