cancerberosgx java-* projects are some java work from when we was a child and was learning - now I want to revive them, put them in github, add support for better build systems, CI and distribution just for fun

# desktop-media-tools

is a small desktop program I made, based on mplayer, mencoder and ffmpeg to watch movies, music, convert music and movies between formats, listen and organize radio medias, desktop screenshot and recording and more

# Build

```sh
gradle
```

and jars should be in `build/libs/desktop-media-tools-0.0.1.jar`

# Run

```sh
java -jar build/libs/desktop-media-tools-0.0.1.jar
```
